# Power-Bi-project
Firstly, in My first project, cleaned it using Power Query Editor in Power BI. I removed any incorrect or duplicate data and filled in any missing values as needed.
Then, I analyzed the data and created visualizations using Power BI Desktop. I designed the appropriate visualizations to display your data in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way. For example, I may have created a bar chart to illustrate the distribution of the data and another to show time-series deviations in the data.
Finally, I created your dashboard using Power BI Service. I organized the different visualizations in the dashboard and added interactive elements such as filters and buttons to help users interact with the data more efficiently.
That's a brief summary of #powerbi My first data analysis project using Power BI #dataanalysis #power #project #help #data #dataanalysis
